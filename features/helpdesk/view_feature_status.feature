Feature: View features
    In order to keep track of the progress of the features in the next release
    In order to be aware of any features giving problems
    As a system administrator
    I want to view the status of features
  
    Features can be in the following states:
    | requested | a system administrator has requested a new feature or a change to an existing feature |
    | accepted  | the developer has accepted the request and placed the feature in a milestone          |
    | pending   | the feature is fully specified, but the tests are not                                 |
    | failing   | the tests are fully specified, but the feature has not been implemented               |
    | passing   | the tests are passing and the feature has been implemented                            |
    | released  | the feature has been released to the users                                            |
    | error     | the feature is not passing anymore and needs to be fixed                              |
